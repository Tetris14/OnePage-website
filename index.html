                        The aim of the Indie Studio is to implement a cross-platform 3D video game with real-world tools. We used RayLib, a very simple C library for 2D/3D graphics. We implemented the library in C++ by using objects and inheritance.

                        The goal of this project is to create a network game.
                        Several teams confront on a tiles map containing resources.
                        The winning team is the one with 6 players who reached maximum elevation.
                        We made the game using C++ and the network with C network library.

                        It's library that implement infinite Int thanks to strings. It has all usefull operators overloaded. It makes the usage of infinit int easier.

                        The goal of this project is to create a server and a client that can communicate through TCP Sockets. The server is able to handle multiple clients.
